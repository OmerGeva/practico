Create an account and start a new challenge, including the skill you want to learn
and your practice goals, then invite your friends to participate in the challenge.

You can measure challenges by the day, hour, or week, and by total time or in a row.
For example you can quit smoking for 30 days in a row, or practice guitar for 30 hours
total.

You can check in either by setting a timer for a practice session or with a checkbox
to confirm you worked toward your goal that day. You can even upload a photo of yourself
after a practice to track your progress.

Best of all you can invite your friends to join the challenge and set the stakes
for the challenge, and even chat with them in-app.

Celebrate your victories!!
